A historical reconstruction project built for the Meta Quest 2, recreating the St. Augustine National Cemetery in VR. Assisiting a six-person team, I led the subteam responsible for converting over 1300 headstone images into usable textures. I trained a custom headstone detection model that output coordinates and headstone types, with visual overlays for verification. Built in collaboration with UCF's humanities department.

## About
I work in software development and creative tech, mostly using Unity and C#. I’ve built systems, UI, and small prototypes across a range of formats. I’ve also used Python for AI training, simulations, and algorithmic experiments, and built both Discord bots and web-based projects over the years.

I usually handle the organizational side of things alongside programming—building timelines, breaking down work, and helping projects stay aligned. I’ve worked in Notion, Trello, and spreadsheets to manage scope and track progress.

I run, rock-climb, and explore systems that sit at the edge of structure and creativity. I like learning how things work and working on projects that make space for curiosity.
